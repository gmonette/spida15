Current todo list:

  o Modify Lform so numerical variables can be symbolically differentiated: partly done with Lfx
  o Modify Lform to allow easier differencing of factors: partly done with Lfx

Changes 
  o Modified 'wald' by adding a 'data' argument that predicts at each value of the data frame and returns a data frame for easy plotting of data and predicted values.
  o Added 'gpanel.fit' and 'fillin' for easier plots of estimated values and standard error bands.
  o Added 'tablemissing' from 'tablemissing' no longer on CRAN (2014-09-14, GM)
  o New functions: 'gd' and 'gd_' replaces 'td' using 'latticeExtra' to create ggplot2-like graphs
    and give better control over non-group graphical parameters (with gd_) (2014-09-13, GM)
  o New functions: 'sortdf' and 'assn' are designed to work well in pipelines (see package:magrittr)
  o Modified 'up' to omit rows with missing values in cluster variables and to detect incorrect combined names when using multiple clustering variables (2014-08-04, GM)
  o Corrected a bug in tab.formula that changed NAs into other values (2013-11-27, GM)
  o Lfx improved and may be ready for prime time with <.factor functions (2013-09-16, GM)
  o getFix.multinom (2013-09-16, GM)

Changes in beta version (2011-02-27 ++):

  o Removed 'nlme' from namespace to avoid conflicts with lme4
  o Extended gsp to allow periodic splines and global constraints, allowing, for example, a spline to have value 0 beyond boundary knots on the left and on the right. 2013 06 16
  o Extended gsp to allow periodic splines. 2013 06 16
  o New method: Lfx
  o Modified Lform and associated functions M and <.factor etc.
    to better handle estimation of differences between levels of a
    factor. (2012-12-03)
  o Added multresp (2011-12-30)
  o Added getFix.zeroinfl (2011-11-26)
  o Added 'weights' for 'tab' (2011-11-26) will add weights as lhs
  o Added 'gicc' for generalized ICC for multilevel data (2011-03-01)
  o Tools for effect plots: Leff and related functions  (in Leff.R)

Branch from spida: (2011-02-27)

Further changes:
	o Modified cLag so it lags correctly within levels of id (2012/04/17-GM)
 
Version 0.1-1 (07-19-2010)
	o Fixed brace() for R

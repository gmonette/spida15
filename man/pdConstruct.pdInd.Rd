\usage{
pdConstruct.pdInd(object, value = numeric(0), form = formula(object),
  nam = Names(object), data = sys.parent(), cov = NULL, zero = NULL,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object inheriting from the class \code{pdInd}, representing
a positive definite matrix with zero covariances except in the first row and
column.}

\item{value}{an option initialization value, which can be any of the
following ...}

\item{form}{an optional one-sided linear formula specifying the row/column
names for the matrix represented by \code{object}.}

\item{nam}{and optional vector of character strings specifying the
row/column names for the matrix represented by \code{object}.}

\item{data}{and optional data frame i which to evaluate the variables names
in \code{value} and \code{form}. ...}

\item{cov}{optional position in lower triangle of covariances that are
estimated and, thus, possibly non-zero. The default is that the covariances
in the first column are estimated and possibly non-zero.}

\item{zero}{optional way of specifying covariances constrained to be equal
to zero. Only the lower triangular portion of the \code{zero} is used. The
elements that are equal to 0 corresponds to the pattern of elements that are
constrained to zero in the covariance matrix.}
